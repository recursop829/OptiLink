Pagecurl.exe is an executable file associated with GIMP, a popular open-source image editing software developed by The GIMP Development Team, specifically in version 2.10.12.0. This file is typically safe to use as it is part of the legitimate GIMP installation, and users can rely on it for various image manipulation tasks. However, like any executable file, it can occasionally trigger false positive alerts from antivirus software due to its functionality or the way it interacts with the system. Users may also encounter errors related to pagecurl.exe if there are issues with the GIMP installation or if the file becomes corrupted, potentially leading to crashes or failure to launch the software. It's important to ensure that GIMP is downloaded from official sources to avoid inadvertently installing malicious software that may disguise itself with a similar name.
