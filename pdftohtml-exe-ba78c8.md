pdftohtml.exe is an executable file associated with the Desktop Plagiarism Checker software developed by Plagiarisma, specifically version 1.22, which is designed to convert PDF documents into HTML format for easier readability and accessibility. While the file itself is generally considered safe when obtained from the official publisher's website, users should exercise caution as executable files can sometimes be bundled with malware or viruses if downloaded from unverified sources. Reports of errors may arise during the conversion process, such as issues with formatting or the inability to process certain PDF files, which can be attributed to the complexity of the source document or compatibility problems. It is advisable for users to keep their antivirus software updated and perform regular scans to ensure that their systems remain secure while using such tools.
